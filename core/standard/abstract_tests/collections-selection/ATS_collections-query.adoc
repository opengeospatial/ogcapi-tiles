^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/collections-selection/query-collections*
^|Test Purpose |Validate support of the optional parameter `collections`.
^|Requirement |/req/collections-selection/query-collections
^|Test Method
| Given:

A tileset for an origin consisting of multiple geospatial data sub-resources (e.g., described in the tileset metadata as being comprised of multiple layers).

When:

Requesting resources either for the tileset or for individual tiles (e.g., a dataset tileset at `{datasetAPI}/tiles/WebMercatorQuad` and dataset tiles at
`{datasetAPI}/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/{tileMatrix}/{tileRow}/{tileCol}`), with a `collections` query parameter consisting of a comma-separated list of collectionIDs
(consistent with the collection identifiers making up that tileset, as described for example, in the tileset metadata layers).

Then:

Assert that the parameter is accepted for valid lists of collectionIDs.

Note that servers are free to restrict valid combinations of collectionIDs (permission /per/collections-selection/valid-collections). Tests should be
restricted to few collections e.g., between one and five. If the sub-collections are also available individually, only collections advertising support for the same TileMatrixSet,
CRS and encodings as used for the request should be selected.
