[big]*i.     Abstract*

_OGC API - Tiles_ is a standard defining building blocks to create Web APIs allowing to retrieve geospatial information as tiles.
Different forms of geospatial information are supported, such as tiles of vector features ("vector tiles"), coverages, maps (or imagery) and other types of geospatial information.
Although it can be used independently, the _OGC API - Tiles_ building blocks can be combined with other OGC API standards and draft specifications for additional
capabilities or increasing interoperability for specific types of data.
The _OGC API - Tiles_ standard references the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set (TMS) and Tileset Metadata standard,
which defines logical models and encodings for specifying tile matrix sets and describing tile sets.
A tile matrix set is a tiling scheme allowing to partition and index space based on a set of regular grids defined for multiple scales
in a Coordinate Reference System (CRS).

This specification is a successor to the OGC's previous Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) standards versions, focusing on simple reusable
REST API building blocks which can be described using the OpenAPI specification.
Whereas WMTS focused on map tiles, the _OGC API - Tiles_ standard has been designed to support any form of tiled data.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This document defines the OGC API - Tiles standard. A web API conforming to this standard can serve tiles of spatially referenced data or maps with predefined content, extent, and resolution. Suggested additions, changes and comments on this standard are welcome and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted using the GitHub repository issues: https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-tiles .
