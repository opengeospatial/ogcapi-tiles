=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards have historically implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using Extensible Markup Language (XML) for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art when some of the initial versions of OGC Web Services were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This architectural style has now a competing RESTful API style that is proposed as an alternative to RPC pattern. A RESTful API style is resource-oriented instead of service-oriented. The Web Map Tile Service 1.0 already defines a resource oriented architechtural style but it lack an API defintion. This OGC API - Tiles standard specifies an API that follows this Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web as well as the W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web.

This document provides de necessary elements to incorporate tile support to an API implementation. These elements can be incorporated in an API based on the OGC API - Features Part 1, core or can be incorporated in an API implementation based on the OGC API – Common Part 1, core. Both specifies a kernel of an API approach to services that follows current resource-oriented architecture practices in the OGC. The OGC API - Common standard provides the foundation upon which implementations of the OGC APIs can be built. The OGC API - common can be combined with this standard and other resource-specific OGC API standards to build and OGC API implementation. However, this standard is done in a way that can extend OGC API - Common but does not make  OGC API - Common mandatory. This way This standard it can be reused as a building block in other frameworks.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for OGC API standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between core requirements and more advanced capabilities. This OGC API – Tiles standard presents the requirements that are relevant for almost everyone who wants to share or use Tiled Data on a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to the Core API.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or API descriptions.
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs will provide building blocks that can be reused in APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting the OGC API - Tiles should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather it should be viewed as a collection of API building blocks which together implement  Tile capabilities. A corollary for this is that it should be possible to implement an API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from the Feature, Coverage, Map, Tiles, and other future OGC Web API standards.

This approach intends to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the API definition without the need to adopt a specific OGC approach (they no longer need to read how to implement a GetCapabilities, allowing them to focus on the geospatial aspects).
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs. In other words, they are not specific for a particular API.

As a result of following a RESTful approach, OGC API implementations are not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way that an OGC API interface can be mapped to an OWS implementation (where appropriate). OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations making the transition easy (e.g. by initially implementing facades in front of the current OWS services).

This document provides simple examples throughout the document. The examples are based on a dataset that contains buildings and the API provides access to the datasets via a single feature collection ("buildings") and two encodings: JSON and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

=== Tiles and maps

WMS and WMTS share the concept of a map and the capability to create and distribute maps at a limited resolution and size. In WMS the number of rows and columns can be selected by the user within limits and in WMTS the number of rows and columns of the response is predefined in the tile matrix.

With time, the concept of a tile, initially used for _map tiles_ has been generalized to other data models such as feature data (some vendors use the expression _vector tiles_) and even to coverage data or processes that can be parallelized dividing the space in tiles. This draft specification presents an approach to tiles that can be applied to almost every resource type that returns geospatial data representations. If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Features standard and on top of a feature collection, the expected result is tiled feature data. If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Maps standard and on top of a collection that is transformed into a map by applying a style, the result should be map tiles (usually in PNG or JPEG format).

This document is part of a series of OGC API - Tiles "parts" that use the core and extensions model. This document includes the "core" and the "root" extension. It is foreseen that future parts will specify other extensions such as how to defined tile matrix sets, how to get tiles from more that one geospatial resource, how to get information of a point in a tile and how to get multiple tiles in a single request. The OGC API Maps is required only to the extent to allow for map tiles to be created on top of a map created by selecting a geospatial data resource with style (or multiple geospatial data resource with styles). An additional extension will deal with time, elevation and other dimensions.

=== How to approach an OGC API
There are two ways to approach an OGC API.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read and API definition document that will specify a list of paths and path templates to resources.

For the first approach, many resources in the API include links with rel properties to know the reason for this relation. The following figure illustrates does links.

For the second approach, the section <<OpenAPIExamples>> will provide some examples of OpenAPI definition documents that enumerate the paths to get to the necessary resources directly.
