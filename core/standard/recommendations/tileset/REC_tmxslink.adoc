^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/tileset/tmxslink*
^|A |To improve interoperability, this standard recommends that the API provides tiles following the TileMatrixSets defined in a TileMatrixSet registry.
^|B |It is also possible to use a TileMatrixSet not available in a registry. In this case the API SHOULD provide a definition of the TileMatrixSet as resolvable URI in an endpoint following the template: `/tileMatrixSets/{tileMatrixSetId}` (where `{tileMatrixSetId}` is a unique identifier of the TileMatrixSet in the service) following the TileMatrixSet schema in http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4
^|C |When the API provides one or more definitions of TileMatrixSets as resolvable URI in `/tileMatrixSets/{tileMatrixSetId}`, the `/tileMatrixSets` endpoint SHOULD respond with the list of TileMatrixSets defined by the API using an object with a `tileMatrixSets` property that contains an array of `TileMatrixSet` objects.
^|D |When the API provides a `/tileMatrixSets` endpoint, this endpoint SHOULD be mentioned in one or more links in the landing page of the API with the `rel` type `http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tiling-schemes`.

NOTE: The common TileMatrixSets defined in http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#61[Annex D] of OGC 17-083r4 and the variable-width TileMatrixSets defined in http://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html#104[Annex E] of OGC 17-083r4 are registered in the OGC TileMatrixSets registry available at http://www.opengis.net/def/tms.
